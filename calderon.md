# Life is a dream, by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca  
  
**SIGISMUND**  
That is true: then let's restrain  
This wild rage, this fierce condition  
Of the mind, this proud ambition,  
Should we ever dream again:  
And we'll do so, since 'tis plain,  
In this world's uncertain gleam,  
That to live is but to dream:  
Man dreams what he is, and wakes  
Only when upon him breaks  
Death's mysterious morning beam.  
  
The king dreams he is a king,  
And in this delusive way  
Lives and rules with sovereign sway;  
All the cheers that round him ring,  
Born of air, on air take wing.  
And in ashes (mournful fate!)  
Death dissolves his pride and state:  
Who would wish a crown to take,  
Seeing that he must awake  
In the dream beyond death's gate?  
  
And the rich man dreams of gold,  
Gilding cares it scarce conceals,  
And the poor man dreams he feels  
Want and misery and cold.  
Dreams he too who rank would hold,  
Dreams who bears toil's rough-ribbed hands,  
Dreams who wrong for wrong demands,  
And in fine, throughout the earth,  
  
All men dream, whate'er their birth,  
And yet no one understands.  
'Tis a dream that I in sadness  
Here am bound, the scorn of fate;  
'Twas a dream that once a state  
I enjoyed of light and gladness.  
  
What is life? 'Tis but a madness.  
What is life? A thing that seems,  
A mirage that falsely gleams,  
Phantom joy, delusive rest,  
Since is life a dream at best,  
And even dreams themselves are dreams.
