# Cyrano

## ROXANE (coming out on the balcony):
  Still there?
  We spoke of a. . .

## CYRANO:
  A kiss! The word is sweet.
  I see not why your lip should shrink from it;
  If the word burns it,--what would the kiss do?
  Oh! let it not your bashfulness affright;
  Have you not, all this time, insensibly,
  Left badinage aside, and unalarmed
  Glided from smile to sigh,--from sigh to weeping?
  Glide gently, imperceptibly, still onward--
  From tear to kiss,--a moment's thrill!--a heartbeat!

## ROXANE:
  Hush! hush!

## CYRANO:
  A kiss, when all is said,--what is it?
  An oath that's ratified,--a sealed promise,
  A heart's avowal claiming confirmation,--
  A rose-dot on the 'i' of 'adoration,'--
  A secret that to mouth, not ear, is whispered,--
  Brush of a bee's wing, that makes time eternal,--
  Communion perfumed like the spring's wild flowers,--
  The heart's relieving in the heart's outbreathing,
  When to the lips the soul's flood rises, brimming!
